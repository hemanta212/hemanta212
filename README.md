### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I'm Hemanta Sharma

I am a student learning software development. I love working on projects involving web, app, and infrastructure development. My toolset includes Python, Go, Dart/Flutter, and JS. I also love hacking with Shell scripting, C, Emacs-lisp, and Racket in my free time.

I work at [Tutero](https://tutero.com) as a Full-Stack SDE I.
